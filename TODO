== Todolist for the osmo-pcap system ==

* Have a shared secret between client/server, send the RAND
  as part of the link type change... use it to decrypt on the
  server.

* Integrate with logrotate, skip the daily rotate in the client,
  handle SIGHUP by closing all files... this would be send as
  a post rotate command.

* Add the end/quit macros to the configure code to the VTY
  configure commands, this is in OpenBSC but deserve to move
  to libosmocore or such...

* Add statistics to both the client and the server and make it
  available through the VTY code.

* Transport pcaps using TLS and have a non-blocking server.

* Make the max size and rotate file configurable
