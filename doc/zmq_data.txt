ZeroMQ data protocol v1
=======================

The osmo-pcap-server can be configured to publish PCAP data to
zero to many subscribers. The following document describes the
data format used.

Multiple clients might be connected to the osmo-pcap-server and
use different link headers depending on the underlying device
data is being captured from.

The messages published are in two categories. These are client
events and client data. Client events are generated on connect,
disconnect, link type change and client data is sent for each
frame.

Client Events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A multi-part message with event.v1.<EVENT_NAME>.<CLIENT_NAME>
as the first part followed by textual data will be generated.
<CLIENT_NAME> is the configured name and <EVENT_NAME> can be
any of:

	* connect
	* disconnect
	* closingtracefile

It might contain more information, such as the filename of the
tracefile that was closed. There is no guarantee for the order
and amount of connect/disconnect messages.


Client Data
^^^^^^^^^^^

A multi-part message with data.v1.<CLIENT_NAME> to allow to
filter for data and a specific client if wanted.

It is followed by the pcap_file_header structure as the second
part and then the data as third part.
